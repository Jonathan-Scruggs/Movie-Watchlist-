Live View: [https://movie-watchlist-orpin.vercel.app/](https://movie-watchlist-orpin.vercel.app/)
##Features
- Two pages search page to add to watchlist(index.html) and the watchlist itself watchlist.html
- Can switch between pages.
- Index page calls to OMDB with the title searched for and display the search results.
- Each result in the search it will add to the watchlist which saves data to local storage.
- Then when the user goes to the watchlist the users data from local storage is displayed

## Things I learnt/practised:
- Use flex: 1 to cause a element to take up any reamaining space.
- By default elements have a flex grow property of 0.
- encodeURIComponent() which allows you to encode something as a URL component
- Dynamic rendering
- Responsive design
- asyns JS with await, Promise objects.
- Async functions return a promise object.
- fetch()
- Working with local storage
